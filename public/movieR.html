    <h1>The Best Movies According To Me</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2> 
    <hr/>
    <h3>Matrix</h3>
    <p>This is my all time favouirte movie, since it gives a clear and modernised picture of vedic ideologies and challenges reality of the wrold. <br>its concepts are just amazing.</p>
    <h3>I Robot</h3>
    <p>This sci-fi movike is my all time favourite since it not only claims the effects of tech living with humans but also touched the <br/> possibilities of rising of consiousness level artificially.</p>
    <h3>Pokrahn</h3>
    <p>Pokran is a hindi movie based on true event of testing of nuclear power by India in 1998, after a faliure in 1995.<br> It reminds the contribution of army, scientist and engineers for welfare of nation. <br/> I personall love the analogy of this film with the great epic Mahabharat.</p>
